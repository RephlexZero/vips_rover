# Rover ROS2 Architecture Roadmap

*Analysis completed: August 8, 2025*
*Implementation completed: August 8, 2025*

## 🎉 Executive Summary - MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

This roadmap identified critical architectural deficiencies that prevented reliable hardware operation. **All critical issues have been successfully resolved** with a comprehensive rearchitecture implementing industry-standard separation of concerns.

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Ready for hardware deployment and simulation development

## 🏆 Critical Issues Resolution Status

### ✅ RESOLVED: Hardware Plugin Mismatch (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: URDF hardcoded `gz_ros2_control/GazeboSimSystem` preventing hardware operation
- **Solution Implemented**: Dynamic URDF parameterization with plugin selection
- **Result**: Same URDF now works for both simulation and hardware modes
- **Commands**: 
  - Simulation: `ros2 launch rover_description simulation.launch.py`
  - Hardware: `ros2 launch rover_description hardware.launch.py`

### ✅ RESOLVED: Simulation Time Configuration (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: Hardware used `use_sim_time: true` causing system hangs
- **Solution Implemented**: Separate controller configurations
  - `rover_controllers_sim.yaml`: `use_sim_time: true`
  - `rover_controllers_hw.yaml`: `use_sim_time: false`
- **Result**: Hardware no longer hangs waiting for simulation clock

### ✅ RESOLVED: Differential Drive Command Interface (HIGH)
- **Problem**: Both rear wheels shared single command variable preventing differential steering
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Split command variables: `hw_rear_left_wheel_velocity_cmd_` and `hw_rear_right_wheel_velocity_cmd_`
  - Independent CAN messages for left/right wheels
- **Result**: Proper Ackermann steering with differential wheel control enabled

### ✅ RESOLVED: CAN Protocol Implementation (HIGH)
- **Problems**: Unit mismatches, wrong message lengths, endianness issues, blocking I/O
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Unit conversions: km/h ↔ m/s, degrees ↔ radians
  - Fixed message lengths: THROTTLE now uses DLC=5 per DBC specification
  - Proper little-endian packing/unpacking
  - Non-blocking CAN reads with bounded loops for real-time safety
- **Result**: Reliable CAN communication with proper real-time behavior

### ✅ RESOLVED: Package Architecture Separation (NEW)
- **Problem**: Mixed simulation/hardware dependencies causing conflicts
- **Solution Implemented**: Clean 3-package architecture
  - `rover_description`: Pure robot description (works for both modes)
  - `rover_hardware_interface`: Hardware-only components (no simulation deps)
  - `vips_driver`: Independent sensor driver
- **Result**: Zero conflicts between simulation and hardware modes

## ✅ Implementation Results

### New Architecture Overview

**Clean Package Separation:**
```

├── urdf/rover.urdf.xacro   # Parameterized URDF (dynamic plugin selection)
├── config/
│   ├── rover_controllers_sim.yaml    # use_sim_time: true
│   ├── rover_controllers_hw.yaml     # use_sim_time: false
│   └── robot_localization.yaml       # EKF sensor fusion config
└── launch/
    ├── simulation.launch.py           # Pure simulation (no hardware)
    └── hardware.launch.py             # Real hardware + VIPS + EKF

rover_hardware_interface/    # Hardware-only components
├── src/rover_hardware_interface.cpp  # Fixed CAN protocol + differential drive
└── include/rover_hardware_interface/
    └── rover_hardware_interface.hpp  # Separate wheel command interfaces

vips_driver/                 # Independent positioning sensor
└── src/vips_driver_node.cpp
```

### Usage - Simple Commands

#### 🎮 Pure Simulation Development
```bash
./scripts/sim.sh
# Launches: Gazebo + Robot + Controllers (NO hardware components)
```

#### 🤖 Real Hardware Operations  
```bash
./scripts/real.sh
# Launches: CAN interface + VIPS + Controllers + EKF sensor fusion
```

### Technical Implementation Details

#### URDF Parameterization
```xml
<!-- Parameters override plugin selection -->
<xacro:arg name="hardware_plugin" default="rover_hardware_interface/RoverSystemHardware"/>
<xacro:arg name="controllers_file" default="rover_controllers_sim.yaml"/>
<xacro:arg name="use_sim_time" default="true"/>

<!-- Dynamic plugin loading -->
<hardware>
  <plugin>$(arg hardware_plugin)</plugin>
</hardware>
```

#### Differential Drive Fix
```cpp
// BEFORE: Single command variable (broken)
double hw_rear_wheel_velocity_cmd_;

// AFTER: Separate command variables (fixed)  
double hw_rear_left_wheel_velocity_cmd_;
double hw_rear_right_wheel_velocity_cmd_;
```

#### CAN Protocol Corrections
```cpp
// Unit conversion: DBC uses km/h, ROS uses m/s
hw_rear_left_wheel_vel_ = velocity_kmh / 3.6;

// Proper little-endian packing
frame.data[1] = pulse_width_raw & 0xFF;
frame.data[2] = (pulse_width_raw >> 8) & 0xFF;

// Real-time safety: bounded read loops
int max_frames_per_cycle = 10;
while (can_socket_->read(frame) && frame_count < max_frames_per_cycle) {
    // Process frames...
}
```
